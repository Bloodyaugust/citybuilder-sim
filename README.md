# citybuilder-sim

An opinionated template for Godot projects. Currently, this branch is up-to-date with v4.0.2.

Following the structure provided by this template can speed up development, especially for jams or prototypes. It's probably not enough for larger projects, but can serve as a good starting point.

This template also supplies a [CircleCI](https://circleci.com/) configuration, preconfigured with the Dockerfile also in this repo, for easy CI builds that also publish to [itch.io](https://itch.io).
